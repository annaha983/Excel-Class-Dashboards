They are to practice organizing information and implementing functions, as well as to stay organized on an academic level. 
If any of the automatic updating cells have not updated, then double click into and out of the cell and it will refresh. 
Checkboxes are live and will update points, percentages and charts.

Navigation links on the left hand side are live and hot. Use CRTL + Click to use the links to navigate. 
Conditional formatting is used on the assignment points column to highlight priority and high value assignments. Thus, if you change a point value, then the conditional formatting highlight will change with it. Also if the column/table is filtered the conditional formatting will remain. 
In the TO DO LIST sheet, imputting the week number will give you a to do list. Checking off the boxes will give you a new motivational picture for each checkmark. If the picture does not refresh, double click in and out of the picture cell.
